Basic rock, paper, scissors game vs the computer.

Learned how to add/call functions and use loops/evaluate conditions. Could clean it up a bit with better use of functions and input validation, however, I need to keep moving. This is just a learning exercise.

After adding  UI learned how to add event listeners and manipulate the DOM on the fly.
